  <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
  <p>programminglanguage. This language is commonly used within web browsers and has the ability to access built-in objects in other applications. It is also .js programming,such as runtime environments such as Node and Windows. JavaScript was originallydeveloped by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation, first named Mocha and later LiveScript, and eventually JavaScript. JavaScript has similar java andsyntax in Sun Microsystems, but this is because both languages are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and Java and JavaScript have no direct relevance. Other than name and syntax, there aremore similarities toself or scheme than Java.
