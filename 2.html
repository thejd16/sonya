  <h2>CSS</h2>
  <p>In the past,it was common to write HTML with design elements. In other words, when we put all kinds of layout and design information into HTML, we turned it into a document for design, not a structured document, which is the main purpose of HTML. It was difficult for even experts to know what this document was like if you only look at the HTML source code because the tags that needed to be tabled were used to organize the layout.
